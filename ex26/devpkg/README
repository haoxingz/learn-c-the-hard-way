devpkg is a tool to install and manage packages.It tracks all the installed
packages by logging their source file URLs in a database file. Every time 
when a new package needs to be installed, devpkg will check the database
if this package has already been installed. If not, the tool will fetch the
source file from the URL given by the user into a temp directory, then 
configure, make and install the package. After the package is installed, 
all the temp directories will be deleted. 


OPTIONS:

-S: Initialize the database file. This must be done before using the tool. 

-L: List the URL of all the installed packages logged by the database. 

-F URL: Fetch the source file located by the URL to BUILD_DIR (.git), 
TAR_GZ_SRC (.tar.gz) or TAR_BZ2_SRC (.tar.bz2). If the target is a tar-ball,
it will be untared into BUILD_DIR. Everything in BUILD_DIR is ready to be 
configured, built and installed. 

-B URL: Configure, build and install whatever is in BUILD_DIR. If installed
successfully the URL will be logged in the database. (This is actually buggy, 
What if the URL you feed to the command is not the source file stored in
BUILD_DIR??) 

-I URL: Combination of FETCH&BUILD commands.  

-c CONFIGURE_OPTION: Used together with BUILD/INSTALL

-m MAKE_OPTION: Used together with BUILD/INSTALL

-i INSTALL_OPTION: Used together with BUILD/INSTALL


KEY DIRECTORIES:

BUILD_DIR = "/tmp/pkg-build"
TAR_GZ_SRC = "/tmp/pkg-src.tar.gz"
TAR_BZ2_SRC = "/tmp/pkg-src.tar.bz2"
